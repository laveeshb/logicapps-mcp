# Workflow Instructions

Step-by-step instructions for handling common user requests. These guide you through the exact sequence of tool calls needed to complete each task.

## Quick Reference

| User Request | Instruction File |
|--------------|------------------|
| "Why is my workflow failing?" | [diagnose-failures.md](diagnose-failures.md) |
| "What does this workflow do?" | [explain-workflow.md](explain-workflow.md) |
| "Show me what's running" | [monitor-workflows.md](monitor-workflows.md) |
| "Create a workflow that..." | [create-workflow.md](create-workflow.md) |
| "Fix this workflow" | [fix-workflow.md](fix-workflow.md) |
| "Clone to Standard" | [../operations/clone.md](../operations/clone.md) |

## When to Use These

Use these instructions when:
- User asks a high-level question that requires multiple tool calls
- You need to gather comprehensive data before responding
- The task has a well-defined sequence of steps

Adapt the instructions based on:
- User's context (which Logic App, which subscription)
- Information already gathered in the conversation
- Specific details the user provides
